# TinyUSB's endpoint buffer size macro (CFG_TUD_HID_EP_BUFSIZE) is a
# TinyUSB compile-time macro. It isn't an IDF Kconfig option (CONFIG_*) so
# it may not be picked up from sdkconfig.defaults by the build system. If
# you still see HID endpoint buffer size issues, keep the following in
# `platformio.ini` build_flags instead:
#   -DCFG_TUD_HID_EP_BUFSIZE=128
# You can try adding it here, but the safe approach is to use build_flags.
#CFG_TUD_HID_EP_BUFSIZE=128
